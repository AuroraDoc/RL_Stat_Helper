# RL_Stat_Helper
To help compare your stats in a game of rl to a set of standard stats that a high level player should use

My main goal with this is to help people compare their stats to stats recommended by an SSL coach. To help players
continue to improve. The recommended stats he uses are in the recommended_stats.txt file

# Imports
  - requests: to use get and post requests from the ballchasing api
  - json: to help get the data into a readable datatype for python

# Plan for Future
I plan on using this to insert data into a website using HTML/CSS and vanilla JS and using flask for the backend
since it is lightweight. I have it framed but just working on connecting the two programs!
